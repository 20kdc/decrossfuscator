Please note that this license may or may not apply to the `released-maps` folder.

These are maps created indirectly from CrossCode versions, but keep in mind these are NOT code in themselves,
 merely mapping from obfuscated names to unobfuscated names.

They are provided for user convenience and are entirely useless as anything but a vague symbol list without the JS files to which they refer.
