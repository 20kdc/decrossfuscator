NOTE: versions/source should ideally be a symlink to versions/steam/0.7.0
NOTE: versions/target should ideally be a symlink to your target version of choice.
This means you can just run a command without args and get the intended effect in all cases.
The only other 'special version' is 'versions/steam/0.7.0', which is the default for rosetta.sh as it's the only one we have a .min.js for

rosetta.sh [ROOT:.] [VERSION:steam/0.7.0] : makes a deobf.map for a version based on official developer pre-obfuscated '.min.js'
forwardmap.sh [ROOT:.] [SRCVER:source] [DSTVER:target] : makes a deobf-forward.map (that's copied to deobf.map) for a new version's JS based on an old version's map & obf. JS
forwardmap-2.sh [ROOT:.] [SRCVER:source] [DSTVER:target] : Tries to use deobf-forward.map to find more matches for deobf-forward.map, copies to deobf.map
mergemap.sh [ROOT:.] [VERSION:target] [MATCHERS:matchers/fixup.json] : starts with deobf-forward.map, adds matchers, overwrites deobf.map
compmap.sh [ROOT:.] [SRCVER:source] [VERSION:target] [MATCHERS:matchers/fixup.json] : starts with deobf-forward.map, adds matchers, overwrites deobf.map
deobf.sh [ROOT:.] [VERSION:target] : creates deobfuscated JS for a version
and `node reobf.js <js> <map>` outputs obfuscated JS,
 this is useful reference source for a modloader developer

lib/ : core libs + Rapture src.
lib/rosetta-global-data.js : global data for Rosetta system
mods/ : Rapture workspace
matchers/ : matcher libraries
matchers/google.json : googlefuncs
matchers/fixup.json : fixes to deobf.map
workfiles/closure-compiler-20120711/build/compiler.jar : must exist & have correct version for rosetta translation of 0.7.0!!!
versions/ : Contains versions in whatever structure you choose.
 versions/steam/0.7.0 : example: 'steam/0.7.0' version, contains 'subdir' and working files
  versions/steam/0.7.0/deobf.map : considered the definitive map for this version, used for forwardmap and created by forwardmap, used for deobf
  versions/steam/0.7.0/deobf-forward.map : Backup copy created *after* forwardmap, and used by mergemap.
                                           Exists so mergemap always starts off of forwardmap's base.
                                           Essentially, forwardmap creates deobf.map solely in case you want to skip mergemap.
                                           NOTE: 0.7.0 doesn't actually have one of these
  versions/steam/0.7.0/rosetta-externs.js : Temporary file used during Rosetta : Externs for ClosureCompiler
  versions/steam/0.7.0/rosetta-emulation.js : Temporary file used during Rosetta : Structurally identical file to dev's OBF version
  versions/steam/0.7.0/rosetta-emulation.map : Temporary file used during Rosetta : Deobf map for rosetta-emulation.js to be ported to dev's OBF version via rosetta process
  versions/steam/0.7.0/subdir/CrossCode : linux startup
  versions/steam/0.7.0/subdir/CrossCode.exe : windows startup
  versions/steam/0.7.0/subdir/assets/js/game.compiled.js : Actual game distribution JS
  versions/steam/0.7.0/subdir/assets/js/game.min.js : Only 0.7.0 has this, but if available, rosetta.sh can create a 'perfect deobf' quickly
 versions/DEMO : example: 'DEMO' version
