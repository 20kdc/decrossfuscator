you're supposed to:
1. set target
2. forwardmap
3. forwardmap-2
4. mergemap
5. forwardmap-2

this is because fixup fixes some broken stuff and forwardmap-2 benefits from these fixes
note that the lack of a final mergemap is so that deletions can be
 used to allow the fixed results to just magically appear,
 which is as it turns out wasn't happening previously
